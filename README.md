# Chatbot

This is a simple text-based chatbot created using Python.

## Note
As per the instructions given, the requirement was to utilize a text file as the dataset. However, I chose to use a JSON format due to its superior capability in maintaining structured data integrity. Additionally, utilizing JSON allows me to dynamically add patterns in real-time, enhancing the chatbot's responsiveness and adaptability.
## Features

- Responds to specific patterns in user input.
- Add more patterns and responses as needed.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- NLTK library
- fuzzywuzzy library
